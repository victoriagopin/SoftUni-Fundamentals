/*
Write a function that takes a single argument as an input. Check the type of input argument. If it is a number, assume it is the radius of a circle and calculate the circle area. Print the area rounded to two decimal places.
If the argument type is NOT a number, print the following text on the console: `We can not calculate the circle area, because we receive a {type of argument}.`
The input comes as a single argument passed to your function.
The output should be printed on the console.
