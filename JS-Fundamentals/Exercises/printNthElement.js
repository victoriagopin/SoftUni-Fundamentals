// Write a function that collects each element of an array, on a given step.
// The input comes as an array of strings. The last element is N - the step.
// The collections are every element on the N-th step starting from the first one. If the step is "3", you need to print
// the 1-st, the 4-th, the 7-th â€¦ and so on, until you reach the end of the array. Then, print elements in a row,
// separated by a single space.
